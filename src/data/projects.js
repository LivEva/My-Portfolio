        work_description: "A full-stack mobile app created with a small team work dynamic through a remote setting using Slack to communicate including daily standups with an extensive kanban board to track progress, to check in with the team with interchangebale leaders hosting each meetup making sure we are keeping on track, up to date with any errors, results, successes. We alternated hosts of the meetings with each person everyday navigating our to do lists and speaking to each member for updates. We started from the intitial concept of 'user stories'. From there we started prioritising tasks and features we wanted as an initial baseline for a completed app and go from there. For backend we used MongoDb with a local extensively tested database. For front end we used React Native and expo to create the core functionality. We had a lot of fun growing this idea and the more we worked on it the more creative we became.",
