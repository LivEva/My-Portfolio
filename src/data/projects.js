        work_description: "A full-stack mobile app created with a small team work dynamic through a remote setting using Slack to communicate. This included daily standups with an extensive kanban board to track progress, check in with the team rotating leadership to host each meetup to make sure we are keeping on track/ up to date with any errors, results, successes. We started from the initial concept of 'user stories'. From there we started prioritising tasks and features we wanted as an initial baseline for a completed app and built on from there. We decided to use MongoDb to store our data which connected with a local extensively tested backend. For front end we used React Native and expo to create the core functionality. We had a lot of fun growing this idea and the more we worked on it the more creative we became.",
        app_description: "This app can be downloaded on IOS and android. A user can create a new account or sign in to an existing. They will be navigated to the main home page where they can see the upcoming careplans. Users can add a new plant through taking a photo or selecting from a gallery and match with a full care plan. They will also be able to recieve notifications prompting them to water/ feed their plants."
