        work_description: "This app was created as part of a team work dynamic through a remote setting using Slack to communicate. Daily standups to check in with the team with interchangebale leaders hosting each meetup making sure we are keeping on track, up to date with any errors, results, successes. We had meetings with a extensively put together kanban board which we checked in our daily standup meetings to asses where we are up to in our progress, what has been achieved, any roadblocks. We alternated hosts of the meetings with each person everyday navigating our to do lists and speaking to each member for updates. We started from the intiial concepts of 'user stories' where we discussed first of all what do we want our users to be able to do while using this app. From there we started prioritising tasks and festures we wanted as an initial baseline for a completed app and decided we would add on from there once the base functionality was compelted. Wr had a lot of fun growing this idea and the more we worked on it the more creative we became.",
        app_description: "This app can be downloaded on IOS and android. A user can create a new account or sign in to an existing. They will be navigated to the main home page where they can see the upcoming careplans. Users can add a new plant by navigating to the 'add plant' tab where they are able to take a photo or choose an exisiting one from their gallery and they will recieve a list of plants with different probability scores. They can select the correct one and this will then be added to their plants list in the 'my plant tab'. There they will see a complete and thorough careplan set up for that specific plant. They will also be able to receieve notifications prompting them to water/ feed their plants in which case they can also click 'watered' next to their virtual plant to keep that one alive as well."
